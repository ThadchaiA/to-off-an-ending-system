Weight pressed behind the quiet ribs.
Ache pooled beneath slow bone.
Grief pulsed in the hollow chest.
Sorrow tightened along tender muscle.
Pressure settled upon still breath.
Pulse slowed in winter silence.
Ache folded into soft marrow.
Longing burned through thin sinew.
Grief thrummed under fading light.
Weight gathered in restless hands.
Pain lingered beneath warm skin.
Ache circled the silent throat.
Despair rooted in tired limbs.
Pressure cracked through brittle hours.
Heartbeats dragged across dull stone.
Longing echoed in empty lungs.
Weight hung from restless shoulders.
Ache rippled beneath quiet air.
Grief drifted through heavy dusk.
Sorrow rested in low thunder.
Pressure deepened in stagnant blood.
Pulse staggered through dim rooms.
Ache coiled around fragile spine.
Longing waited under muted dawn.
Weight sat on shallow breath.
Pain shimmered beneath cold sweat.
Grief tightened within quiet veins.
Sorrow beat against closed lids.
Pressure hushed the racing heart.
Pulse trembled in hollow dark.
Ache throbbed along hidden nerve.
Longing pressed on silent lips.
Weight darkened under quiet rain.
Pain drifted through dull hours.
Grief pooled in shadowed marrow.
Sorrow echoed in brittle bone.
Pressure hummed across tense skin.
Pulse stilled in pale hush.
Ache whispered beneath gauze twilight.
Longing tugged at tender seams.
Weight stretched over sleepless ribs.
Pain closed upon waking light.
Grief cooled in narrow spaces.
Sorrow flooded slow minutes.
Pressure bowed the careful neck.
Pulse faltered at soft dawn.
Ache twisted in lean silence.
Longing pulsed in quiet cloth.
Weight ached beneath steady breaths.
Pain murmured through damp sheets.
Grief tightened around patient dusk.
Sorrow pooled behind silent eyes.
Pressure traced the collarboneâ€™s curve.
Pulse fluttered in thin shadow.
Ache settled inside low hum.
Longing stilled beneath cool sheets.
Weight dimmed the fragile chest.
Pain threaded through mute twilight.
Grief pressed against hollow time.
Sorrow deepened in aching wrists.
Pressure cloaked each quiet step.
Pulse waned among dark hours.
Ache drummed under cooling skin.
Longing drifted within blank walls.
Weight lingered over slow dawn.
Pain folded into muted room.
Grief hummed beneath soft fabric.
Sorrow warped the gentle breath.
Pressure stilled the velvet dusk.
Pulse echoed along grey matter.
Ache crawled in silent marrow.
Longing coiled beside wan light.
Weight sank in shallow lungs.
Pain hushed the fragile dawn.
Grief pooled upon closed throat.
Sorrow hovered in quiet organs.
Pressure seeped through porous bone.
Pulse staggered beneath dead calm.
Ache rattled along calm nerves.
Longing slept within still blood.
Weight lodged in tender cartilage.
Pain settled like dusk ash.
Grief beat against thin ribs.
Sorrow draped the breathing night.
Pressure spread across waiting flesh.
Pulse paused at sudden hush.
Ache wound through dwindling warmth.
Longing slowed the final gasp.
Weight clouded the dim corridors.
Pain struck at patient tissues.
Grief leaked through silent pores.
Sorrow bent unfinished fiber.
Pressure thickened the warm dark.
Pulse dimmed toward hollow hush.
Ache melted into somber sinew.
Longing cooled atop bruised light.
Weight staggered under hushed pulse.
Pain rumbled beneath grey dawn.
Grief dwelled inside hollow walls.
Sorrow throbbed with silent thunder.
Pressure filled the aching night.
Pulse drowned in quiet storm.
Ache weighed against hidden breath.
Longing broke the distant heartbeat.
Weight hushed the final silence.
