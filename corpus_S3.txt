Hands repeated the quiet ritual.
Footsteps counted the narrow hall.
Breath paused at each doorway.
Knuckles tapped the wooden frame.
Fingers folded into patient rest.
Steps traced the same small circle.
Shoulders leaned against silent glass.
Arms crossed against dull chill.
Routine settled into careful corners.
Knees bent before empty chairs.
Palms flattened on cold table.
Lips pressed into muted line.
Eyes checked the locked latch.
Hands drifted toward missing keys.
Steps turned back, then forward.
Habit laced the morning cup.
Breath measured the cooling air.
Fingers drummed on chipped mug.
Moves rehearsed without an audience.
Head nodded to absent cues.
Feet found the carpet’s edge.
Hands hovered above light switch.
Gestures echoed in fading room.
Back straightened before dull mirror.
Steps halted at cracked tile.
Hands wiped the dustless shelf.
Fingers rolled an unseen coin.
Breath synced with ticking clock.
Shoulders slumped at twilight chime.
Arms lifted folded laundry twice.
Routine paused at window latch.
Knees settled onto hard floor.
Hands unlocked, then relocked, the gate.
Steps paced the narrow porch.
Thumb traced worn photograph edge.
Eyes glanced at silent phone.
Breath touched the frosted pane.
Fingers circled chipped porcelain rim.
Neck turned toward empty stair.
Hands folded stubborn newspaper crease.
Feet rocked on tired heels.
Habit poured the final drop.
Steps softened at bedroom door.
Hands knotted the hanging rope.
Breath held inside the sleeve.
Fingers twirled a broken ring.
Arms tightened around dull ache.
Shoulders rolled beneath dim light.
Steps shuffled across thin rug.
Hands reset the crooked frame.
Breath counted distant siren tones.
Knuckles cracked in hollow room.
Routine checked the second lock.
Feet hovered above quiet stair.
Palms faced the failing sky.
Hands fidgeted with loose thread.
Head bent toward silent song.
Steps stopped at threshold line.
Lips mouthed unfinished phrase.
Eyes scanned the empty sink.
Hands traced forgotten carving.
Breath fogged the silver glass.
Fingers tapped the cracked screen.
Arms stretched toward fading lamp.
Shoulders shrugged at still shadow.
Steps lingered by open drawer.
Hands brushed along bare wall.
Routine lingered at broken switch.
Knees pressed into rough grain.
Feet matched the floorboard squeak.
Hands smoothed rumpled blanket edge.
Breath waited for kettle click.
Fingers twitched above cold keys.
Head shook at silent tune.
Steps turned the hallway bend.
Hands pinched the burning wick.
Eyes closed at slow refrain.
Arms folded beneath dim coat.
Shoulders tensed at rising wind.
Habit polished the empty glass.
Feet paused on final tile.
Hands whispered against turning page.
Breath hid in cotton sleeve.
Fingers slowed upon brass knob.
Steps circled the tiled square.
Hands shadowed an absent greeting.
Routine marked the wooden post.
Knees knelt beside lone shoe.
Feet rocked to silent rhythm.
Palms felt faint heartbeat.
Hands timed the blinking light.
Breath sank into wool scarf.
Fingers locked around cool rail.
Arms opened to still air.
Shoulders eased beneath soft rain.
Steps quieted at broken stone.
Hands tapped forgotten melody.
Eyes lingered on folded coat.
Habit lit the hallway lamp.
Feet weighed the gentle slope.
Hands sheltered a trembling flame.
Breath dimmed inside the mask.
Fingers sorted scattered screws.
Head nodded at empty echo.
Steps backtracked the worn path.
Hands caught the falling leaf.
Routine dusted the silent frame.
Knees pressed against tired earth.
Feet traced yesterday’s imprint.
Hands sealed another envelope.
Breath slowed in early dusk.
Fingers brushed fading letters.
Arms braced the wavering door.
Shoulders lifted uncertain weight.
Steps melted into soft carpet.
Hands measured the cooling kettle.
Eyes watched the curtain sway.
Habit closed the rusted latch.
Feet aligned with careful seam.
Hands matched the ticking hand.
Breath hovered over lukewarm tea.
Fingers chased loose thread again.
